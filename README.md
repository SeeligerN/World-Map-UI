# Risk-Map-UI

This project  is the UI for the board game (Risk)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)]. 
No Game Logic is implemented. The countries are stored as a graph and displayed in the window. 
This is meant as a tool for anyone wanting to implement the boardgame without bothering with the UI.
